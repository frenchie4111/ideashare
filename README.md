Ideashare Website
=================

This is a webiste that I built as a proof of concept example to something I 
eventually wanted to make into a full blown webiste. The basic idea behind 
the site is that users are able to post ideas of their own, or post
"Inklings" (Suggestions for other ideas) on other peoples submissions. The
site is intended to also eventually be used for networking between people
who have ideas, and people who have the skills necessary for completing those
ideas.

Known issues
------------
-[ ] Voting  has been turned off due to multi user bug
-[ ] When users submit an inkling it should update the inklings box and show their submission
-[ ] Javascript should be updated to have more efficent onclick listeners
